# Kubernetes

Tools for running a bunch of different containers

**Config file** -> desc abt different services and how it interact with each

**Cluster** -> is a set of VMs (one or 100s and 1000s of VMs)

All these VMs are refered to as _Node_

All this is managed by **master** - program to manage everything in the cluster

Master reads Config file and implements it.

Big reason to use K8s

* communication between services is very easy
* replicating services is very easy.

### Steps

* create image for different services
* create **config file**.
* feed config file to k8 using kubectl.
* each Container is kept inside a **Pod**.
* to manage pods created , k8 will create deployment -> its job is make sure all specified pods are running correctly and restarts pod if its down.
* to have network support between pods (should be specified in config file)
k8 will introduce **service** which means it gives n/w access to running pods in cluster.
If a pod wants to access another pod, it will access another pods **service**.

## Important Terms
* k8 Cluster - collection of nodes + a master to manage them all.
* node - vm that will run our container.
* pod - running conatiner inside a k8 cluster, but technically a pod can run multiple container.
* deployment - Monitors a set of pods, make sure they are up and running and restarts them if they crash.
* service - provides an easy to remember URL for accessing a running container

## k8 Config file

*tells k8 abt diff deployments, Pods , services required(collectively called as objects).
*written in YAML syntax
*write config file in project source code.
*It is possible to write without config file ,but do not use this.

## Terminology in Config file

1. apiVersion -> implys version of k8 to look for (k8 is extensible and we can create new objects as well)
1. kind -> implys type of object needed to be created eg- Pod
1. metadata -> metadata about the object
1. spec -> specs to be followed inside the object
here containers (notice its an array which implys there can be many container in a pod not vice versa.) 


## Deployment
In k8 , we don't create pod with specific config directly but shd be created under a k8 object called **deployment** .

There are two main reason for it 

* Will make sure there is consistent number of pods running as specified in config file. If pod gets failed for any reason it will restart it.

* When we wanted to update pods under a deployment, deployment will create new set of updated pods and deployment will be mapped to them, older version pods will be killed.


Simply put deployments are manager for pods


## Updating image in the deployment 

Use latest tag in pod spec section, and push the image to dockerhub with **latest** tag.
then RUN kubectl rollout restart deployment posts-depl


## Services 
Its is also an k8 object, that can be used to 
* communicate between objects
* communicate an pod outside cluster 

Different types of services

1. Cluster IP -> sets up an easy to remember url to access a pod . Only exposes pods inside cluster .

1. Node Port -> access a pod outside the cluster. Usually only done in dev environment only.

1. Load Balancer -> makes a pod acessible from outside the cluster (right way to do)

1. External Name -> Redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url.

### Node Port

In service config file, **targetPort** is actual container port (server that we defined to listen to) and **port** is **Node_Port_Service** which will direct traffic to our running container inside.


### Cluster IP 

used to communicate between pods **inside** k8 cluster
