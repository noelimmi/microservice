# Kubernetes

Tools for running a bunch of different containers

**Config file** -> desc abt different services and how it interact with each

**Cluster** - is a set of VMs (one or 100s and 1000s of VMs)

All these VMs are refered to as _Node_

All this is managed by **master** - program to manage everything in the cluster

Master reads Config file and implements it.

Big reason to use K8s

-> communication between services is very easy
-> replicating services is very easy.

### Steps

* create image for different services
* create **config file**.
* feed config file to k8 using kubectl.
* each Container is kept inside a **Pod**.
* to manage pods created , k8 will create deployment -> its job is make sure all specified pods are running correctly and restarts pod if its down.
* to have network support between pods (should be specified in config file)
k8 will introduce **service** which means it gives n/w access to running pods in cluster.
If a pod wants to access another pod, it will access another pods **service**.

## Important Terms
[*] k8 Cluster - collection of nodes + a master to manage them all.
[*] node - vm that will run our container.
[*] pod - running conatiner inside a k8 cluster, but technically a pod can run multiple container.
[*] deployment - Monitors a set of pods, make sure they are up and running and restarts them if they crash.
[*] service - provides an easy to remember URL for accessing a running container

## k8 Config file

-> tells k8 abt diff deployments, Pods , services required(collectively called as objects).
->written in YAML syntax
->write config file in project source code.
->It is possible to write without config file ,but do not use this.

## Terminology in Config file

1. apiVersion -> implys version of k8 to look for (k8 is extensible and we can create new objects as well)
1. kind -> implys type of object needed to be created eg- Pod
1. metadata -> metadata about the object
1. spec -> specs to be followed inside the object
here containers (notice its an array which implys there can be many container in a pod not vice versa.)
