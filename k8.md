# Kubernetes

Tools for running a bunch of different containers

**Config file** -> desc abt different services and how it interact with each

**Cluster** - is a set of VMs (one or 100s and 1000s of VMs)

All these VMs are refered to as _Node_

All this is managed by **master** - program to manage everything in the cluster

Master reads Config file and implements it.

Big reason to use K8s

-> communication between services is very easy
-> replicating services is very easy.
